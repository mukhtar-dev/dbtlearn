## 📘 About This Project

The project focuses on building a scalable data transformation pipeline using **dbt (Data Build Tool)** and **Snowflake**. The data used is Airbnb listing data, and the pipeline includes:

- Raw data loading into Snowflake
- Staging models
- Fact and dimension models
- Data tests and documentation
- dbt docs generation

- Configured my own dbt environment and connected it to Snowflake
- Ran all models, tests, and documentation builds successfully
- Understood and replicated key concepts in:
  - dbt model structure (staging, marts, etc.)
  - Source and model testing
  - Using Jinja and dbt macros
  - Deploying with dbt CLI
